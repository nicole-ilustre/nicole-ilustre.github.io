      <td class="question">Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?</td>
      <td class="answer">I do believe in mindfulness and I have practised it in the past. In fact, I have been to a 7-day mindfulness retreat in Bali a couple of years ago. I learned different types of meditation and have read a bunch of books about mindfulness. Although, I haven't been practising it lately as life got in the way and it is something you have to work on consistently.</td>

      <td class="answer">Overall experience with mindfulness? Hardwork but rewarding.</td>

      <td class="answer">To meditate at least 20mins a day.</td>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What was it like to be fully listened to?</td>
      <td class="answer">It felt good but I also felt a bit self-conscious. I felt like I had the responsibility to tell the story in a way the listener will fully understand.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">What was it like to fully listen?</td>
      <td class="answer">I was a bit distracted in the first 30secs which is not goo.d I do this most of the time, zone out and then realise I should be listening and then pull myself back in. It is really important to listen mindfully throughout as you could be missing important details.</td>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What did you notice about your learning style? What resources worked for you and why? </td>
      <td class="answer">I noticed structure is really important for me and I do have the urge to tick everything on the checklist which can be a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. A good mixture of visual (video and reading) and hands-on (practice coding) is the best for me. I easily get distracted and bored if I stick to one type for a long time.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?</td>
      <td class="answer">Definitely the feeling of having to master the basics! There were a few times when I did not completely grasp the idea and I spent so much time researching and trying to figure it out. It was difficult for me to convince myself to just take what I understand and move on because most of the time things are explained further and some concepts are easier to grasp the more we get into the lesson. But I always cling on to the idea that I have to get this now.</td>

  <h2 id="devtools">Devtools Tutorials</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?</td>
      <td class="answer">I noticed that I had to mix things up frequently, go from one topic to another. This way I am keeping it fresh all the time. The down side of it though is not getting in a flow. I feel like I'm not giving myself a chance to get in the flow in one subject before jumping to another. I have to find a balance between both.

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</td>
      <td class="answer">There were a few times where I had to stop and go to another topic as I was just not getting the current one I am studying. The DOM is quite new to me so I had to understand the very basics of it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="question">How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</td>
        <td class="answer">I have 10 tabs currently open. 8 are study related and 2 are still study related but random google searches of how to do something.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="question">Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name or some inappropriate words into the DOM of a website? If not, do so now. It's hilarious and a great way to amuse your non-technical friends. They will think you are a hacker wizard.</td>
        <td class="answer">II changed a photo of a reporter on stuff.co.nz to a poop photo and showed my partner. He was proud.</td>
