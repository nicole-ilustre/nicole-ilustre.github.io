        <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
        <nav>
            <li class="nav"><a href="../index.html">Home</a></li>
            <li class="nav" id="nav-left"><a href="#footer">Footer</a></li>
        </nav>
        <div>Every element (h1, h2, div, dpan, li, etc) has a container. A container is like an invisible box where the element lives. 
            <br>You can adjust the spacing of the container using margins and paddings. We will discuss more about these later.
            <br> Let's talk about borders first...</div>
        <img src="border.png">
        <div>That thick black square on the image above is the border of the content or element. It is clear or transparent, with no setting by default.
            <br>You can change different setting style for your border. You can change the thickness, the color, the pattern and many more.
            <br>The code below is the code for the border on the image above.
        </div>
        <img id="border-code" src="border-code.png">
        <div>Now that you know where the border is, it will be easier for you to understand margin and padding.
            <br>So basically, margin is the space between the border and other elements. It is <b>OUTSIDE</b> the border.
            <br>Whereas, padding is the space between the content and the border. It is <b>INSIDE</b> the border. 
            <br>Some more key differences are:
            <ul>
                <li>Margin can be negative. Padding cannot</li>
                <li>Padding and Border Alter Dimensions. Margin does not.</li>
                <li>Margin can be auto. Padding cannot.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>WHEN TO USE...</h2>
            <tr>
                <td><h3>MARGIN</h3></td>
                <td><h3>PADDING</h3></td>

            <tr>
                <td>When you want to have some space around an element, or you don’t want the element to touch other elements around it.</td>
                <td>When you don’t want your content to touch the edges of the container. Example: you have a bunch of &lt;p&gt; elements inside a div and you don’t want the text inside &lt;p&gt; elements to touch the div’s border</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>When you want to center an element.</td>
                <td>When you want the background of the element to be displayed in the produced gap. Example: you have a green and an orange div adjacent to each other, and you want both divs to touch each other, but don’t want their texts to touch each other.</td>
