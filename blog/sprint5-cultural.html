      <td class="question">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</td>
      <td class="answer">I'm a bit surprised as to how I react to bugs or things not working out the way i want it to work. I must admit, I'm a person who get frustrated easily and when I am also very expressive with my frustration. But so far, throughout the foundations, I haven't had an "explosion of emotions" yet. I find that when faced with a probled, I do feel overwhelmed and frustrated but I don't react violently like I would normally do. I find that I channel my frustration by either getting more motivated to solve the problem or I try to step out and avoid the problem for a little bit. 
          <br>Adding more to the previous one, I realised that I really do need control in my life. I think the reason why I don't get as frustrated as much with programming is cause I know I am in control. I can make changes to fix it. Unlike other factors in life where sometimes you have no control over them so you just have to accept the circumstance.
          <br>This last one is not really a new thing but the core learning has cemented the idea. I have been known to be hard on myself most of the time. I set really high expectations for myself and when i don't meet them right away, I feel disappointed by myself. But almost always, I just need time to get it. Especially with programming. I need to be patient with myself and understand that I will not always get it right the first time.</li>

      <td class="question">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</td>
      <td class="answer">I think your core values mostly drive your why when it comes to learning and programming. It is the reason what your doing this for. Self-awareness comes in the process of learning. Knowing what your habits, tendencies, strengths and weaknesses are and how to manuever them or how to use them to your advantage can definitely help your learning process. As simple as being aware when to take breaks will make learning a bit easier. Empathy can be felt both directions. Be empathetic towards yourself. Especially as I mentioned above, I can be my own worst critic. I have to learn to be empathetic to myself and avoid being harsh to myself. Also empathy towards others. We are going to be working with other people who have different strengths and weaknesses, just like us only different. Empathy will be crucial to be able to work harmoniously with others.</td>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</td>
      <td class="answer">I guess I never really highlighted the relevance of human interpersonal skills in relation to programming or learning programming. In the forefront, I've always thought it's about learning how to work with computers Core learning has made me realise that even though we are in front and we are working directly on the computer, the work is stil centered around people, working for people and with people.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</td>
      <td class="answer">I think the most challenging aspect for me is looking within and reflecting and writing them down. I've mentioned in previous blog entries before that I am not very good at expressing myself through writing. But I am getting the hang of it. I just have to keep doing it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</td>
      <td class="answer">To prepare us for the real world. In reality, we will never be able to always work independently without people. Core learning is teaching us how to be better programmers in terms of interacting with other humans and also interacting with ourselves. A code or a syntax or even a solution to a bug can be Googled but attitude, values and soft human skills can only be developed in practice and within.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</td>
      <td class="answer">Honestly, it does feel like it is a waste of time as I'm doing it. But the thing is the result is not experienced or felt during the time I'm learning core. It is also used as we go by our day to day lives, studying or just doing everyday stuff. I find that the lessons learned from core is used in real life during real life scenarios and situations. It is not something tangible. It's more like general knowledge, you never really know when you will be using that information but when you are asked that question, you will be able to whip your knowledge out and use it.</td>
