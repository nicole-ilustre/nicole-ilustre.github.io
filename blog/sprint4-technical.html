            <h2>That time I got stuck on a simple problem</h2>
            <p>I was working on one of the challenges during Foundations. It was an easy one and I was fairly certain with my code. I kept reading the challenge, revised my code 20 times but could not for the life of me, figure out what's wrong. I got frustrated and I got up, went for a walk, had something to eat and agot back to the challenge a couple of hours later. I did my process from beginning to end, still the same result. I resorted to looking at other people's code. And the second I opened up someone's repository, I realised what was wrong with my code. I was missing one word. ONE WORD. And when I fixed it, voila! My code works. It wasn't my solution that was wrong, it was just a typo. It feels very frustrating having to go through all that just because of a tiny mistake. But now, I will never forget that one word whenever I nees to use that code.

            <h2>That time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
            <p>I wouldn't call it an elegant way but it is something that I am happy with. I was working on one of the challenges during Foundations and I got stuck with the solution. I went over it again and again. I was on the verge of giving up and was just about to ask my fellow cohort members on Slack. I was typing my question and explaining what I'm trying to do when it clicked. After I typed my explaination, I got the solution. I used the rubber duck method unexpectedly! Rubber ducky method is when you use a rubber ducky (or any inanimate object), and explain to it what you're trying to do. You usually understand more when you explain it yourself to someone else, or in this case a rubber ducky.

            <h2>Problem solving techniques and proccesses</h2>
            <p>There are a bunch of problem solving techniques and processes out there. Some of them are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pseudocode</li>
                    <li>Trying something</li>
                    <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
                    <li>Reading error messages</li>
                    <li>Console.logging</li>
                    <li>Googling</li>
                    <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
                    <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                    <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                I find that I tend to use a few of these more than the others. I think my most use methos is reading error messages. I find that it is the easiest and fastest way to get to the problem. But this depends on how big the problem is. Next is Googling. With every question I have, I always run to Google. 90% of the time I get what I'm looking for through forums and articles. When I get stuck, I always tend to do the rubber ducky method. Most of the time, by the time I repeat what my problem is, I realise what the solution is. I admit I try to really hold off asking for help from peers and coaches, not because I do not want to ask for help but because I want to exhaust all my resources first before asking for help. I want to be able to solve the problem myself. I am still struggling with pseudocode. It doesn't really come naturally to me but I will definitely be working on it. Overall, problem solving still feels overwhelming to me at times but so far it has been bearable.
