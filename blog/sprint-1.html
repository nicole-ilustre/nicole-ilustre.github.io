   <div class="Q-A"><h2>Command Line Primer</h2>
    <h3 class="question">In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h3>
   <p class="answer">Command line is another form of communication or another way of navigating and controlling your computer. Most people are used to navigating through the visual navigation where you click on arrows and buttons. Command line does the exact same things, the only difference is that you are communicating with your computer through plain text. 
    The only analogy I can think of is following a recipe when cooking. GUI is like watching a video of the dish being cooked and seeing visually the steps taken. Whereas, command line is like following a recipe from a book that is text-based and no video or photo. All instructions are in text.</p>
