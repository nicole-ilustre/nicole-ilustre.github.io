            <p>When I first decided to learn computer programming, I wasn't fully convinced that it would be something I would enjoy or excel in which is one of the biggest reason why I decided to do a bootcamp instead of a full university degree. I do envision myself building a successful career in the tech industry, although I am not 100% certain yet what exactly I want to be doing. So I plan to apply the lean start up approach. I am going to learn the basics, become a web developer, see how I go from there. While I'm doing that, I plan to study and learn more about the different languages and hopefully that will eventually lead me to what I really want to focus on and what I really want to achieve.

                            <td>I will work on finding the balance between both. Usually, I try to do everything I can to find the solution to a problem or to do a task on my own until I have exhausted all my efforts and if that doesn't yield anything, I will have to muster the confidence and as much as possible, write down the problem and the question. This way it will be easier for me to appraoch people for help.

I wouldn't stop until I've done things perfectly. A perfect example is my obsessiveness to get all the stars or to get a perfect score in a game and I will keep playing over and over again until I get it. Obviously, this drive helps me get things done.

                            <td>I will learn to reassess a problem and determine how big it is and how much effort and time should I be putting on it. I have to learn to stick to a timeline and not deviate too much.

                            <td>I usually take notes or code along with the video. That way I am physically doing it as well. I think this is the best way for me to learn.

            <h2 id="workload">Workload</h2>
            <p>Since the beginning of foundations, I have thoroughly planned my schedule, daily and hourly. This way I feel like I have things controlled and I know I am achieving what I need to achieve in the day. I have also allocated extra time just in case I do end up needing more time on a specific project. As long as I keep to my schedule, I think everything will be under control. But when things do get to me, I usually channel my frustration somewhere else. I train aerials and circus a lot as a hobby. I have aslo planned my training schedule around studying. So if ever I do get frustrated, I will step away for a little bit and train and usually that does help me recover.

            <p>I am such a why person and I need to know the end goal and the objective. I expect that all project objectives are communicated well and all expectations from us are also well communicated. I expect to be shown the answer to any of my questions by explaining it and going through it together and not just answered with a short answer. I expect them to be patient and understanding as I am sure we will have our moments of struggle and frustration.

            <p>Besides studying full-time, I am also prioritising my own personal trainingas this really helps me focus on studying and helps me deal with frustrations and distractions. I normal train at night either between 5:30-7:30 or 6:30-7:30. I also plan to take at least half a day off a week to avoid burning out. So I am hoping to get either Sunday or Saturday off of just relaxing and recuperating. I have put everything on my calendar and it is just a matter of sticking to the schedule.

            <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>When I started foundations, I said that I will be letting the chips fall where they may in terms of my career path. I still am planning to do the same only this time I do have an idea what destination I want to be heading towards. I want to make a positive impact to the world in terms of helping save the planet. I've always wanted to be a part of a company that works toward environmental development. I'm not sure which company yet or what sort of project or technology I want to be a part of but it will definitely be in the environmental development industry.

            <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <p>My biggest non-technical challenge would probably be working in groups or in pairs. I'm an introvert and it takes a lot of effort for me to be around other people. My energy gets drained after a few hours of interpersonal interaction and would always need alone time to recuperate. So I'm a bit worried about spending hours of intense work in a group setting. I also work and think well alone. But hopefully, I ghet to better myself at this through the bootcamp.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>I really want to work on my ability to work with groups. Don't get me wrong, I love social interactions. In fact, I do believe that I have good bangter and can carry myself in social settings but in saying that, I do really prefer keeping to myself especially when it comes to work. I perform better when working alone but I know working with teams is a necessity in any industry so I want to improve in that aspect.

            <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
            <p>I expect great organization. If the team is organized, it makes me feel like I'm on top of things as well.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>I expect myself to work hard. No questions asked. I do have somewhat a system when asking for help. I will try to exhaust all my efforts into solving the problem first and if that doesn't work I will have a look if I have an upcoming check in with a facilitator and if I do, I plan to ask my question then because then that gives me more time to solve the problem on my own. Most of the time, I solve it before I even get to chat with the facilitator so that's good. If not, then have a chat with the facilitator.</p>
