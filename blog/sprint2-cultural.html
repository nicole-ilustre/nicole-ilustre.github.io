            <h2>Career Pathway</h2>
            <p>When I first decided to learn computer programming, I wasn't fully convinced that it would be something I would enjoy or excel in which is one of the biggest reason why I decided to do a bootcamp instead of a full university degree. I do envision myself building a successful career in the tech industry, although I am not 100% certain yet what exactly I want to be doing. So I plan to apply the lean start up approach. I am going to learn the basics, become a web developer, see how I go from there. While I'm doing that, I plan to study and learn more about the different languages and hopefully that will eventually lead me to what I really want to focus on and what I really want to achieve.

                            <td>As long as I have the goal in mind or I know what the objective is, I am motivated to achieve them on my own and can find ways to reach the objective by myself.

                            <td>But this can also sometimes be my weakness. Most of the time, I really don't feel comfortable asking for help. I do not like the feeling of disturbing others and on the other hand, I also do not like the feeling of depending on others. I feel helpless. </td>
                            <td>I will work on finding the balance between both. Usually, I try to do everything I can to find the solution to a problem or to do a task on my own until I have exhausted all my efforts and if that doesn't yield anything, I will have to muster the confidence and as much as possible, write down the problem and the question. This way it will be easier for me to appraoch people for help.

                            <td>This is mostly a strength for me as it helps me achieve things. I get obsessive over a lot of things. Playing games, solving a puzzle, solving a problem. I wouldn't stop until I've done things perfectly. A perfect example is my obsessiveness to get all the stars or to get a perfect score in a game and I will keep playing over and over again until I get it. Obviously, this drive helps me get things done.
                            </td>
                            <td>But sometimes, I find it hard to let go and end up spending way too much time on one small thing. It also affects my mood sometimes as I get upset or be really distracted because I would keep thinking about that one thing.
                            </td>
                            <td>I will learn to reassess a problem and determine how big it is and how much effort and time should I be putting on it. I have to learn to stick to a timeline and not deviate too much.

                            </td>
                            <td>This can sometimes be a limitation as there are times (there were times in foundations) where we needed to watch a video or we needed to read articles and it was hard for me to keep focused and not get distracted.
                            </td>
                            <td>I usually take notes or code along with the video. That way I am physically doing it as well. I think this is the best way for me to learn.
