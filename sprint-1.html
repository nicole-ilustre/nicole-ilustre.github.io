  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</td>
      <td class="answer">Command line is another form of communication or another way of navigating and controlling your computer. Most people are used to navigating through the visual navigation where you click on arrows and buttons. Command line does the exact same things, the only difference is that you are communicating with your computer through plain text. 
        The only analogy I can think of is following a recipe when cooking. GUI is like watching a video of the dish being cooked and seeing visually the steps taken. Whereas, command line is like following a recipe from a book that is text-based and no video or photo. All instructions are in text.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</td>
      <td class="answer">Honestly, I am struggling a little bit with the timebox. The time given doesn't seem enough for the content that needs to be studied. Although in saying that, it is just the first day and it is the first few parts of the first sprint. So hopefully, I will get into a rhythm and stick to the timebox.</td>

      <td class="answer"><ul>
        <li>pwd = displaying the current directory you are in</li>
        <li>cp = copying a file/directory to another directory</li>
        <li>mv = renaming/moving file to a different directory</li>
        <li>mkdir = creating a new directory</li>
        <li>new-item =  creating a new file</li>

  <h2 id="install-and-explore-git">Install and Explore Git</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Whats the difference between git and GitHub?</td>
      <td class="answer">Git is the local software you use to control and navigate around your own local repository. This is mostly used for individual projects. Github is the cloud-based platform used to store and share work and used for collaborations with other programmers as it has features useful when sharing work. Commiting is like saving a checkpoint in a game which is a save point you can come back at any time.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</td>
      <td class="answer">It is the same as storing photos in your devices and storing photos on the cloud such as Google photos. You can create an album online and invite people to add photos in your shared album but they cannot do that in your device album. A commit is like saving a checkpoint in a game which is a save point you can come back at any time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</td>
      <td class="answer">I noticed that I am the type of person that needs to see the bigger picture and the why. So far, from the resources I noticed it's quite common to learn the small basic details first and then putting them all together. After learning what I think was sufficient amount of basic information about the topic, I got to a point where I got confused as to how I was supposed to use all of that code that I just learnt. And then I came across this specific video which put them all together and I felt so much better and I felt that I understood the subject more.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</td>
      <td class="answer">Just trust in the learning process that way I won't get too frustrated.</td>

  <h2 id="branch-pull-merge">Branch, Pull, Merge</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What is main?</td>
      <td class="answer">The master branch of a project where it is at its best condition.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Why create a Branch?</td>
      <td class="answer">To be able to work on projects and make changes without messing up the master branch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?  
      </td>
      <td class="answer">Commit is saving a point in your work where you can revert back to. You'd want to commit for lots of reasons. Some of them are 1. when you finish working on a feature and you want to save your work at that stage so you can carry on working on different features and not worry about sabotaging the previous work you did. 2. If you want to try something new or different but aren't sure if it's going to work or not, you want to save your current work progress so you can revert back to it if needed. 3. You also want to keep a record of your work.</td>

<div class="Q-A">
  <h2 id="github-fork-clone">GitHub Fork & Clone</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What are some examples of when you would fork?</td>
      <td class="answer">When you want to work on a open-source code, you would want your own repository and commit and push to that everytime until you finish and then do a pull request to the upstream repository.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</td>

      <td class="question">What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? </td>
      <td class="answer">I never liked introducing myself to a group of strangers. It feels like I could never do justice to who I actually am in a couple of sentences. I try to be just as vague as possible when introduing myself and use humour as a cover up.
