  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What makes code more readable for you?</td>
      <td class="answer">Code readability for me is a mixture of all the qualities I've read, DRY(don't repeat yourself), Keep it simple, etc. But personally, I think a code is readable when it's easy and wuick for someone else to read and understand your code. I think that is the most important factor.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?</td>
      <td class="answer">I prefer tabs but after learning about clean code, I will start using 2 spaces indentation.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?</td>
      <td class="answer">I try to keep my workspace organised but I do admit that as the day goes by and as I keep working, some bits and pieces get out of place but at the end of the day, I make sure that everything is back in its right place. Pretty much the same as my code. I try to be as organised and clean as I can but I find sometimes, it gets a bit out of hand especially as more code is added on but I always try to clean it up afterwards as much as I can.</td>

      <td class="question">Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:</td>
      <td class="answer">function sum(x, y) {<br>
        return (x + y);<br>
    }
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?</td>
      <td class="answer">I don't think I've had sufficient pratice of both to certainly know what I prefer but so far, I am liking TDD as it goes really well with my learning style. I like having a goal and knowing the purpose of my project so being defined by TDD does help me a lot in putting my code together and it makes me feel more confident as I know that every code tha I write is constantly being tested.</td>

  <h2 id="kata">Kata</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?</td>
      <td class="answer">So far it seems pretty similar to github so it doesn't seem confusing to me. I like the immediate response when you run your code. I also like the layout of it as it makes it easy to navigate around.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?</td>
      <td class="answer">Yes, it was. I was actually looking and reading through the tests more than I was reading the instructions from the handbook. I feel like I get to solve the problem on my own that way more that reading the instructions. But at times I get stuck, I usually try to get more information from the instructions from the handbook.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?</td>
      <td class="answer">Rubber ducky, for sure. A little bit of pseudocoding. I find that I tend to understand a problem a lot more when I read error messages. It points me to where I did wrong and what I did wrong.

      <td class="question">What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?</td>

    <tr>
        <td class="question">Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?
        </td>
        <td class="answer">Yes. It seems like I always do. Most of the time I try to look for other ways to code it. I also look at the sample solution and compare it to mine, just to get ideas as to other ways to do it.</td>
