      <td class="answer">I have added a new html and css file in a new directory and have committed and pushed it to my existing repository on GitHub. Now I have a new page with html content and css (with no content yet) on my blog page.</td>

      <td class="question">What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</td>
      <td class="answer">I struggled a little bit with concentrating and not getting distracted as the courses got a bit too mundane and boring. I had to take a few more breaks than normal but that's ok. Speeding the videos also helped keep my attention longer.</td>

      <td class="question">What are of you proud of from this challenge?</td>
      <td class="answer">To be honest, I am actually really proud and happy that I've already done the freeCodeCamp course so I just wizzed through it to review and then did the Udacity course afterwards. I felt like my previous self-study helped me a lot.</td>

      <td class="question">Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  </td>
      <td class="answer">This is the story of how humans were created. There was a God who wanted to create some sort of creature. This creature will be called a human. The God said 'Humans should be able to see the beauty of the world, I will give them eyes'. And then he said 'I will give them a mouth to eat and talk'. 'I think they need hands to hold things. And also feet to walk', he said. After coming up of a list of body parts that the human needs, the God asked 'Now how do I put these together to make it look good?' So he went to work and put together different parts together, some worked, some didn't. He decided to put the eyes and the mouth on the head and he put the hands in the middle and the feet at the bottom. This is the story of how humans were created. This is the story of HTML and CSS.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">Any moments of surprise or joy?</td>
      <td class="answer">I feel a certain type of euphoria every time I figure out a code without having to looking it up. Whenever I think of an element or a CSS design to add and I try to figure out first before googling it and then the code works, it's a feeling of bliss.</td>
