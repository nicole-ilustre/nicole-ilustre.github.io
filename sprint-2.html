      <td class="question">What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</td>
      <td class="answer">I struggled a little bit with concentrating and not getting distracted as the courses got a bit too mundane and boring. I had to take a few more breaks than normal but that's ok. Speeding the videos also helped keep my attention longer.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">What are of you proud of from this challenge?</td>
      <td class="answer">To be honest, I am actually really proud and happy that I've already done the freeCodeCamp course so I just wizzed through it to review and then did the Udacity course afterwards. I felt like my previous self-study helped me a lot.</td>
