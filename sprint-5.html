      <td class="question">What was the hardest moment of this challenge for you? How did you overcome them?</td>
      <td class="answer">There were a lot of difficult moments, I must admit. I also tackled them through different ways. My go-to problem solving techniques such as rubber ducky, reading error messages and pseudocoding were in full swing. And when those didn't work, I had to pull out the big guns. I asked helped from my facilitator and we had an hour and a half long session. He was so pateint and he definitely made me see the problem in a different way. I like how he didn't give me the answer straight away but went through the problem with me. There was one thing that I think defeated me though. (Although, I do think it's a bit too advance for me anyway). There was this feature that I wanted to put in my code but I spent almost a day in total and I could not figure it out. It was not in the challenge, it was just a feature I thought of so in the end, I concluded that it is not worth any more time. I just told myself that after the bootcamp or sometime in between, when I know more, I will go back to my code and add it in.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">What learnings are you going to take away from this challenge?</td>
      <td class="answer">A lot. I learned a lot of technical stuff that I think will definitely be used in the future again and again. I have experimented a lot, like how I write my code, my techniques on tackling the challenge, my habits and tendencies on writing my code and I have observed them and kept them all in file in my head and will definitely be working on these moving forward. I need to see what works well and what doesn't, what need improving or what needs to be eliminated (bad habits).</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?</td>
      <td class="answer">No, I have never done pai programming before. Looking forward to doing it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during bootcamp? Why so?</td>
      <td class="answer">I think it will be the biggest challenge as I am used to working alone. But hopefully, I will develop this skill.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What was the most challenging part of this calculator exercise for you?</td>
      <td class="answer">The most challenging part motivating myself to start the project. I was a bit unmotivated starting a new big project but as I got in the flow, it got better.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">What was a highlight?</td>
      <td class="answer">I was surprised it was slighlty easier than the other challenges like minesweeper. I think it's because I have had a few practice projects and also obviously, I am very familiar how a calculator works so it was easier for me to pseudocode it..</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question">Which pairing role did you enjoy most? Why?</td>
      <td class="answer">I did it alone as I wanted to practice more on my own. I know we have a lot of time pair programming in the Bootcamp.
